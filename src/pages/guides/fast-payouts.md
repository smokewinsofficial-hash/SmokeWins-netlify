## Snapshot
- Aim for Interac e-Transfer where available (often the fastest for CAD).
- Complete verification **before** your first withdrawal.
- Keep deposit/withdrawal method consistent when possible.

## Fast-payout checklist
1. **Verify early:** Photo ID + address + payment ownership.  
2. **Use one method:** Prefer the same method for deposit & withdrawal.  
3. **Keep limits realistic:** Large jumps in amount can trigger manual review.  
4. **Withdraw in daytime (ET):** Back-office teams process faster in business hours.  
5. **Respond quickly:** If they request docs, upload in the original format, uncropped.  
6. **Avoid bonuses with high wagering:** They delay cashout.  
7. **Enable 2FA** for email and payment apps.

## Typical timelines (once approved)
- **Interac e-Transfer:** minutes – a few hours.  
- **Cards (Visa/Mastercard):** 1–5 business days (often credited as reversal).  
- **E-wallets (Skrill/Neteller):** same day – 48h.  
- **Bank transfer (wire):** 1–5 business days.

## What slows KYC
- Blurry photos, cropped edges, mismatching name/address, or different funding source.  
- Multiple accounts, VPN/proxy use, or large first-time withdrawals.

## When to contact support
- Status stuck over 48h **after** KYC approved.  
- You’ve provided all docs and payout method is eligible but no movement.  
- Ask for the **payout reference** if they say it’s sent.
