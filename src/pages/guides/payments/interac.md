## Overview
Interac is widely supported by Canadian operators. It’s familiar, fast and trusted. Availability and names may vary by provider (e.g., Interac e-Transfer® via payment processors).

## Deposits
- Typical per-transaction limits depend on your bank and operator.
- Funding source is your Canadian bank account.
- Usually near-instant once approved.

## Withdrawals
- Often supported via Interac e-Transfer; processing time depends on operator KYC status.
- Ensure your account is verified to avoid delays.

## Fees & limits
- Operators typically do not charge Interac deposit fees; banks may apply their own limits.
- Check operator T&Cs for minimum/maximum per transaction.

## Speed
- Deposits: near-instant after confirmation.
- Withdrawals: after approval, often same day to 1–3 business days.

## Verification notes
- Standard KYC: government ID + proof of address may be requested.
- Use the same name on your bank account and operator account.

## Pros & cons
**Pros:** Familiar, widely supported, bank-backed, fast.
**Cons:** Limits vary by bank/operator; withdrawals may require completed KYC before release.

## Tips
- Keep email and bank alerts enabled for transfer confirmations.
- If a transfer fails, check daily limits and try a lower amount.
