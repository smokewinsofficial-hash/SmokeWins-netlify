## Overview
Interac is one of the most widely supported Canadian payment options. It connects directly to your Canadian bank account and is familiar, fast, and secure. Operators may present it as **Interac e-Transfer®** or via a payment processor that routes through Interac.

## How deposits work
1. Choose **Interac** on the cashier page.  
2. Enter the amount (CAD) and continue to your bank selection.  
3. Authenticate with your bank (app or web) and approve the e-Transfer/request.  
4. Return to the operator; funds usually appear **near-instantly** once approved.

**Typical deposit notes**
- **Min/Max**: set by the operator (e.g., min CAD 10–20; max varies).  
- **Bank daily limits**: your bank may cap Interac e-Transfers per day.  
- **3DS/extra checks**: not needed; bank login approval is the strong auth.

## How withdrawals work
1. Select **Interac e-Transfer** (or Interac payout) in the cashier.  
2. Enter the amount and confirm the destination email/phone as requested.  
3. Operator reviews the request (KYC may be required).  
4. After approval, you receive an Interac notification to **deposit** into your bank.

**Typical withdrawal notes**
- **Processing**: operator approval + Interac send; often **same day to 1–3 business days**.  
- **Name match**: your player account name must match your bank recipient name.  
- **First payout**: expect KYC before first withdrawal.

---

## Fees & limits
- **Operator fees**: most do **not** charge Interac deposit fees; check T&Cs.  
- **Bank fees**: banks typically don’t charge to receive e-Transfers, but verify your plan.  
- **Limits**: per-transaction and daily bank limits apply; operators also set their own caps.

---

## Speed expectations
- **Deposits**: near-instant once approved by your bank.  
- **Withdrawals**: after operator approval, commonly **same day** to **1–3 business days**.

> Delays usually come from pending verification, weekend/holiday cut-offs, or bank daily limits.

---

## Verification (KYC) checklist
- Government-issued **photo ID** (passport/driver’s licence).  
- **Proof of address** (utility bill/bank statement; typically last 3 months).  
- **Bank evidence** (sometimes requested): redacted statement or account screenshot showing your name.

**Tips**
- Use the **same full name** on your operator and bank accounts.  
- Enable **2FA** on your email and operator account.

---

## Pros & cons
**Pros**
- Bank-backed, familiar, widely supported in Canada.  
- Fast deposits; withdrawals straightforward after KYC.  
- No card details shared with the operator.

**Cons**
- Bank/operator limits vary; daily e-Transfer caps can block larger amounts.  
- First payout may be slower due to verification.  
- Not every operator supports Interac for **both** directions.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Deposit pending/failed**: check bank daily limit, try a lower amount, or wait for reset time.  
- **No payout option**: some brands offer Interac deposits only; choose bank transfer or an e-wallet for withdrawals.  
- **KYC requested**: submit documents promptly; mismatched names cause delays.

---

## Security & good practice
- Approve transfers only inside your **bank’s official app or site**.  
- Keep email secure (2FA) — Interac notifications arrive by email/SMS.  
- Review operator T&Cs for **payment and withdrawal policies** before depositing.
